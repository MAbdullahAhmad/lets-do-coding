# Relative Grade Calculator

    Difficulity: Medium
    Genre: Logic

Input `highest` and `lowest` marks in class. Then input marks of three students and show their grades.

So that if marks are 10 to 30,
there are total 20 numbers in between 10 and 30.
for these 20 numbers:
- First 25% (i.e., 10/10+ & <15) will get D
- 25% to 50% (i.e., 15/15+ & <20) will get C 
- 50% to 75% (i.e., 15/15+ & <25) will get B 
- 75% + will (i.e., 25/25+ & <30) get A

If above list is not discriptive, we will make 4 equal parts between lowest(10) and highest(30). For these 4 parts, we have D C B A grades from lower to higer.

It is upto you that you wanna deal invalid inputs or not.
